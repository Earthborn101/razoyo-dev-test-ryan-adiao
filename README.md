# Razoyo Developer Front end test
## By Ryan Christipher D. Adiao

To run this Phoenix project, follow the instructions below:
  * Update your local Elixir version to Elixir 1.14.2. 
  * Install or update local Phoenix version to v1.7.0-rc.0. This is important because v1.7.0-rc.0 has build-in Tailwind library.
  * Clone this repository.
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`. Don't need to run mix ecto.create. This project doesn't need a database.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` to access.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
